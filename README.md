# Next.js WordPress Starter

Scaling WordPress with the power of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the static web!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### Requirements
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
* [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)

Add an `.env.local` file to the root with the following:
```
WORDPRESS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="http://wordpressite.com/graphql"
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is this and what does it include?


### Requirements
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
* [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)

### Environment

This project makes use of WPGraphQL to query WordPress with GraphQL. In order to make that request to the appropriate endpoint, we need to set a environment variable to let Next.js know where to request the site information from.

Create a new file locally called `.env.local` and add the following:

```bash
WORDPRESS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="[WPGraphQL Endpoint]"
```

Replace `[host]` with your the home URL of your WordPress instance.
